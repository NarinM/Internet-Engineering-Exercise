## AVR Watch with LCD
This project has been created with CodeVision and proteus and will be able to simulate a watch system using ATmega16 microcontroller.

### How to run
#### The Script (.c)
You can use any text editor in your computer to open this C file. Also, a compiler like GCC or G++ is required to compile this file to a binary output. However, you can use the HEX file which is added in this repository to stave some unwanted issues off.

#### The Proteus (.pdsprj)
The protues file is created using Proteus 8.2 and you have to install this versio or higher versions to be able to open this file. After openning, choose the hex file for the microcontroller's input data and run the project!
